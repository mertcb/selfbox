# SelfBox Server

In SelfBox server we are using Mongoose and MongoDB + Express.js  
As you can think MongoDB conenction string should be private but don't worry we will share an example database for you  
  
Before move on dont forget to open a .env file with;

```env
PORT = 8080
MONGO_URI = mongodb://<username>:<password>@localhost:27017/selfbox
```

# Database Example
We will talk about late :)
